# Character Portrait Images

This directory contains character portraits for the Narrative Guide system.

## Required Images:

- `old_man_neutral.png` - Default neutral expression
- `old_man_blink.png` - Eyes closed for blinking animation  
- `old_man_happy.png` - Happy/satisfied expression
- `old_man_serious.png` - Serious/focused expression
- `old_man_thoughtful.png` - Thoughtful/contemplative expression
- `old_man_disappointed.png` - Disappointed/concerned expression

## Image Specifications:

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Size**: 250x250 pixels (square)
- **Style**: Portrait view of character face/upper body
- **Background**: Transparent or matching game theme

## Implementation Notes:

The narrative guide system expects these exact filenames. The blinking animation overlays the blink image over the main portrait to create a natural eye-blinking effect.
