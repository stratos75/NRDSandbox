  <h1>New Retro Dawn: The Kid's Journey Begins</h1>

  <h2>Scene 1: The Bedroom Portal</h2>
  <p>
    The Kid sits in his darkened bedroom, a tattered note in one hand, the mysterious console in the other. The TV screen hums softly, casting neon reflections across the cracked walls. The Kid hesitates, his loyal terrier by his side, both staring at the swirling portal forming before them.
  </p>

  <h3>Choices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jump In Now:</strong> The Kid grabs the terrier and leaps into the portal without a second thought.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspect the Console Again:</strong> He studies the console, noticing strange alien glyphs glowing faintly, hinting at secrets yet to be revealed.</li>
    <li><strong>Look Back at the Room:</strong> He takes one last glance at his reality — the posters, the flickering CRT, the arguments muffled beyond the door — before embracing the unknown.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scene 2: The Enchanted Forest (First Level)</h2>
  <p>
    The Kid lands in a dense, burning forest. Smoldering trees twist toward the sky, and the night above is alive with shifting neon auroras — always watched by the entity beyond. Strange, corrupted wildlife lurks, and the air crackles with static energy.
  </p>

  <h3>Choices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Find Shelter:</strong> Search for a cave or hidden tunnel to plan the next move (may unlock early armor card reward).</li>
    <li><strong>Fight Through:</strong> Charge forward, confronting the twisted creatures head-on (chance to earn a high-risk weapon card).</li>
    <li><strong>Scout Quietly:</strong> Sneak along the edges, gathering information and resources (may find rare crafting components).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Levels (Teasers)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monochrome City:</strong> Cold, disconnected — echoes of the Kid’s urban struggles, only the important elements stand out in color.</li>
    <li><strong>Ground Zero Reactor:</strong> Psychedelic illusions and swirling radiation, reality fractures and reshapes.</li>
    <li><strong>The Final Space Nexus:</strong> A cosmic void where the girl who remembers waits, joined by the super-intelligent dog piloting the upgraded mech.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Every choice brings you closer to breaking the cycle. Choose wisely.</em></p>
